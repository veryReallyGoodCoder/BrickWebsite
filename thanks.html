            If you have made it this far, it means you have some serious dedication to the task you are doing. Congrats on making it through the literal heeps of trash throughout life that would lead you to want to keep searching for something worthy on this website I made almost purely to troll you.

            You have shown significant optimism, courage and determination and I thank you for your commitment to trying to find at least some good in the things faced. Your strength is something to behold and you should be proud of yourself and know that I admire you.

            All the best on this journey of life, the creator of this website :)
